Lisbon is one of the best places for a city break in Europe due to its affordability, it is diverse tourism offerings, it is plethora of day trip options and, of course, it subtropical/typical Mediterranean climate. I love Portugal for many reasons but one of the things that appeal to me most about it is the short, very mild winters and warm summers.  Lisbon is a great addition to a European summer adventure, it is a great spot for a spring city break but Lisbon is also the perfect place to escape for some late European sun in September and October.You get the idea. Lisbon is seriously worth adding to your bucket list. In this blog post I am going to share with you the best things to do in Lisbon, the best way to get around Lisbon, the best areas to stay and explore in Lisbon and my favourite finds!From exploring the Tagus River, Time Out Market, LX Factory and Alfama to hiking up to Castelo de São Jorge, snapping Torre de Belém, Rossio Square and the 25 de Abril Bridge, Lisbon offers it all.

But on which side does the famous hot air balloon in Turkey fall? Do not worry, it is amazing! Like really, really amazing. I have traveled through Turkey a few times, once I overland from the East of the country, crossing in from Georgia, via public transport, all the way across to Istanbul. There I celebrated my 30th birthday. One of the best cities in the world, probably my second favorite big city after Bangkok. And the highlight of my time in Turkey? The Cappadocia Hot Air Balloon. I know, it would be much cooler to say something obscure, having spent so much time in Turkey. But honestly, the hot air balloons in Turkey live up to the hype. It is epic.

This capital of the Veneto region has all of these islets separated by 170 canals, and connecting all of them is around 400 bridges. There are dozens of small and large bridges in Venice, the most important of which is undoubtedly the Ponte della Libertà (Liberty Bridge) which connects Venice to mainland Europe. Many tourists come into Venice over this road or the railroad on the bridge. Venice is the only major city in Europe in which vehicles are not allowed. Venice is known by names like “City of Canals,” “City of Masks,” “City of Water,” “City of Bridges,” and “The Sinking City.” There are endless numbers of things to see in this city and endless numbers of things to do.
